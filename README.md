EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect and classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). Spam emails often contain unwanted advertisements, phishing content, and other forms of unsolicited messages that can be harmful to recipients. The goal is to build an efficient and accurate spam detector using Python and machine learning techniques.
# Solution
We propose to use supervised machine learning techniques to train a model that can classify emails as spam or ham. The solution involves preprocessing the email text data, extracting relevant features, training various machine learning models, tuning their hyperparameters, and evaluating their performance. We will also create additional features to improve the model's accuracy.
